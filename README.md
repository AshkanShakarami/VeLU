# VeLU
VeLU: Variance-enhanced Learning Unit for Deep Neural Networks

This is the base version of our work: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15051

The full version includes an extensive appendix covering additional vision benchmarks, a critical discussion section, and an extended theoretical analysis of VeLU (covering theory assumptions and proofs). These materials will be made available upon acceptance of the paper at the targeted venue.
